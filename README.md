## About Me
Currently working as an analyst/trader in the securitized products space.

My finance folder is filled with random ideas and code I found/tinkered about math/finance for idea generation. I unfortunately cannot share any real world trading.

My emacs file is for the non-technical user (such as myself) to hopefully help someoene else get started with this great text editor.
