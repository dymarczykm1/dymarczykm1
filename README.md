## About Me
Currently working as a trader in the securitized products space. 
Would love to collaborate with anyone currently working as an algo trader. 

My finance folder is filled with random ideas about math/finance.

The optimizer for DFS comes from https://www.nicksniche.net/ and the fantasy football pandas exploration comes from https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/.

Shoutout goes to both Nick and Ben. Please check them out/support them!

## NFT Data Set
The data from the NFT file comes from Kaggle. If you are interested in exploring the data for yourself, you can use the same github link that I use in my file. The github user is hemil26 who will update the file every 15 days. Appreciate him maintaining the dataset and allowing for public use of his work!

## UFO Sightings Data Set
Another data file from Kaggle. Pretty interesting to see the type of craft people reported seeing and what states seem to have a high level of extraterrestrial activity. Please feel free to the use the file from my data folder. I scrubbed the data to remove as much noise as possible. Check out my code to remove those pesky white spaces from the file. Caveat that this data is all self reported, but the truth is out there folks.
