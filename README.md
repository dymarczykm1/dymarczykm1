## About Me
Currently working as a analyst in the securitized products space.

My finance folder is filled with random ideas about math/finance. I unfortunately cannot share any real world trading examples/data analysis.

The optimizer for DFS comes from https://www.nicksniche.net/ and the fantasy football pandas exploration comes from https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/.

Shoutout goes to both Nick and Ben. Please check them out/support them.

## NFT Data Set
The data from the NFT file comes from Kaggle. If you are interested in exploring the data for yourself, you can use the same github link that I use in my file. The github user is hemil26 who will update the file every 15 days. Appreciate him maintaining the dataset and allowing for public use of his work!
