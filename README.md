## About Me
Currently working as a trader in the securitized products space. 
Would love to collaborate with anyone currently in HFT in the fixed income markets.

The optimizer for DFS comes from https://www.nicksniche.net/ and the fantasy football pandas exploration comes from https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/.

Shoutout goes to both Nick and Ben. Please check them out/support them!

## NFT
The data from the NFT file comes from Kaggle. If you are interested in exploring the data for yourself, you can use the same github link that I use in my file. The github user is hemil26 who will update the file every 15 days. Appreciate him maintaining the dataset and allowing for public use of his work!
