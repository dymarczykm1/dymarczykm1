## Fixed Income
The files located in this directory are some real world examples of how fixed income portfolio managers will compare their holdings to that of the benchmark. For the newly initiated, a benchmark a basket of securities that the portfolio managers are trying to beat in terms of performance. This is easier said than done however and a lot goes into the decision making process.

## Index and Portfolio Statistics Files
The holdings vs benchmark is a simple comparison of the the percentage amount that is held in the portfolio vs that of the benchmark. In the core example provided you can see the portfolio is underweight the index vs 2.0s coupons. How you want to manage this portfolio is by where you want to be underweight vs overweight the index in terms of coupon. Do I think 2.0s will underperform in the index? Then I want to make sure I am underweight. Will 3.0s out perform? Then I want to be overweight. This is an incredibly simple example as security selection (are the specific bonds the index owns better or worse than the ones I own?) is very important. Every bond is different, but you want the best bonds.
